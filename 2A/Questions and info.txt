H index(274 leetcode)

Question 2 (Lab 1 - evaluated):
In this problem, a set of N points are given on the 2D plane. You have to find
the minimum distance pair of points.
For example:- P[] = {2, 3}, {12, 30}, {40, 50}, {5, 1}, {12, 10}, {3, 4}.
Minimum distance is 1.41 between pairs of points {2, 3} and {3, 4}.
Write a program divide and conquer algorithm with probable complexity order. Write your logic
as comments in the program for its better understanding and evaluation.
