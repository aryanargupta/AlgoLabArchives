Question 1 (Lab 0 - not evaluated):
Pancake Sorting

Question 2 (Lab 1 - evaluated):
Given an unsorted array arr[] of length N and an integer K, count the occurrences (or frequency) of K in the given array using the Divide and Conquer method. Note that, minimum length of the array is 100


Question 3 (Lab 2 - evaluated):
Implement quick Sort using 2 pivot elements

Question 4 (Lab 3 - not evaluated):


Question 5 (Lab 4 - evaluated):
Longest Palindromic Subsequence


Question 6 (Lab 5 - evaluated):
Use greedy approach to find the minimum number of subarrays in an array such that sum of all subarrays is >=0 and all positive numbers are included in the subarrays. You can exclude any negative number in the final subarrays. For example:

Array = {1, 2, 3, -4,-5, 8, -6, 7, 9, 1, -100, -99, 1}
Minimum subarray count = 2 (Subarrays: {1,2,3-4,-5,8,-6,7,9,1}, {1}) -> (Excluded -99 and -100 from final answer)
